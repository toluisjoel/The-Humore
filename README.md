### If not humor, then what ?

The news is mostly filled with negative and sad stories and most of us don't like thais and wonder if the world can get any better.
Is there anything you can do about it ? Yes alot of things, but let's start off with this python script that sends you funny, weird, strange and positive news, but never negative news.
