# The Humore  ðŸ™ˆ
### If not humour, then what ?

The news is mostly filled with negative and sad stories and most of us don't like this and wonder if the world can get any better.
Is there anything you can do about it? Yes, a lot of things, but let's start off with this python script that sends you funny, weird, strange and positive news, but never negative news.

## Getting Started

1) For security reasons, you will need to create a new gmail account for this.
2) After creating the account, open the gmail app and go into settings,
3) click on the ["Security"](https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-privacy) tab, scroll till you find "Less secure app access"
It's usually off by default, click on the toggle and enable it on.
